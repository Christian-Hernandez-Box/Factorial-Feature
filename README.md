# Factorial Calculation with Test-Driven Development (TDD)

## Project Description

Welcome to the **Factorial Calculation with Test-Driven Development** repository! Here, we embark on a journey of building a robust factorial method using the principles of Test-Driven Development (TDD). Factorials, denoted by an exclamation mark (n!), involve multiplying an integer by all integers less than it. For instance, 5! equals 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1, resulting in 120.

In this project, we employ a systematic approach following the **red-green-refactor cycle**:

1. **Setup**: Prepare the environment by defining test cases and expected outcomes.
2. **Exercise**: Implement the factorial method within the `Calculate` object, based on the test cases.
3. **Verification**: Validate the correctness of the implementation by comparing actual results with expected outcomes using assertions.

To ensure comprehensive testing, we utilize the `assert` module and the Mocha testing library. This enables us to validate the factorial method's functionality for typical cases and edge cases, such as the special handling of 0 factorial (0!).

## Key Components

- **Test Cases**: Validate the output of factorial calculations for various integers, including edge cases.
- **Red-Green-Refactor Cycle**: This iterative development approach ensures incremental improvements and maintains code integrity.
- **Calculate Object**: The factorial method resides within this object, encapsulating the core functionality of the project.
- **Index_test.js and Index.js**: Test code resides in `index_test.js`, while implementation code is housed in `index.js`, adhering to a clear separation of concerns.

By diligently following this structured approach to TDD, we aim to craft a reliable and efficient factorial method capable of handling diverse scenarios with confidence and precision.
